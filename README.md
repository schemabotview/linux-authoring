# Linux Authoring

Linux course authoring project, based on the reusable seven-stage course authoring template.

## Current status

Stage 01: the Linux course brief is confirmed. The requirements draft is available at `01-requirements/requirements.md` for review before course planning.

## Workflow

## Start a course

1. Copy this entire template into a separate course directory, such as `linux-fundamentals`. Keep the original template reusable.
2. Open `01-requirements/ai-prompt.md`, supply only the course topic, and run it in ChatGPT or Claude. It will propose default audience, prerequisites, outcomes, and scope for your confirmation before generating requirements.
3. Save the response as the stage output listed below. Review it before using it as input to the next stage.
4. Continue in order, attaching the earlier documents requested by each prompt. A chat cannot read a local path unless filesystem access is actually available.
5. Use the other model to review major drafts against their completion checklists. Resolve findings using sources and technical checks; model agreement alone does not establish correctness.
6. Approve the course brief and pilot lesson before scaling production. Record release approval before publishing.
7. Use feedback to propose a revised requirements document and repeat affected stages.

| Folder | Prompt | Generated document |
|---|---|---|
| 01-requirements | ai-prompt.md | requirements.md |
| 02-planning | ai-prompt.md | course-plan.md |
| 03-design | ai-prompt.md | design.md |
| 04-implementation | ai-prompt.md | implementation.md |
| 05-test | ai-prompt.md | test-plan.md |
| 06-deployment | ai-prompt.md | deployment.md |
| 07-feedback | ai-prompt.md | feedback.md |

## Working conventions

- Prompts are reusable instructions; generated documents are course-specific artifacts. This template intentionally contains no fabricated course outputs.
- Preserve stable requirement, outcome, module, and lesson IDs across revisions.
- Record input revisions, assumptions, and Draft/Approved status. An AI-generated checklist is not evidence that its checks ran.
- Generate full lessons individually after approving the curriculum and design; `implementation.md` describes their production process.
- Website content and video scripts should derive from the same approved lesson source.
- Keep credentials and personal learner information out of prompts and the public repository.
- The deployment prompt creates a publishing plan. Actual deployment and video upload are separate actions.

## Context is entered once

Stage 01 establishes the confirmed course brief. Stages 02–07 inherit it from the requirements document and approved stage outputs. There are no repeated course-context forms. Each stage proposes its own relevant decisions, and material changes to the approved brief require confirmation.
